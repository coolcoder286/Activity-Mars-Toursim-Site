    <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only
        Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".
        The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish
        appearance, that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
